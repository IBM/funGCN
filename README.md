### Functional Graph Convolutional Networks and Feature Selection

The repo contains the code to perform two models: 

1) **Functional adaptive Feature Selection with elastic-net penalty (ffs)** using a Dual Augmented Lagrangian algorithm for the following models:
    * *Function-on-Function* (FF)
    * *Function-on-Scalar* (FS)
    * *Scalar-on-Function* (SF)
    * *Logit* (with functional features and categorical response)


2) **Functional Graph Convolutional Networks (fgcn)**. 
The model estimates a knowledge graph and implements a GCN to work with multi-modal (longitudinal, scalar, and categorical) data and cuncurrently 
perform different tasks (regression, classification, forecasting).

### REQUIREMENTS

1) Create a python3.11 environment: `conda create -n my_env python=3.11`
2) clone funGCN (main branch)
3) install funGCN and required packages by running `pip install -e .` 
at the root of the repository, i.e. where the setup.py file is.
4) Lunch the desired experiments, e.g., `python expes/ffs/sim_FF.py`
